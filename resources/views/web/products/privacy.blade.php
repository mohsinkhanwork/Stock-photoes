        <h4 style="font-size: 21px;"><b>4. Steps Taken to Protect personal Information</b></h4>
<ol class="ol1"></ol>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1" style="color: black;font-size: 14px;">Protecting the security of User personal information is of the utmost importance to us. We maintain a variety of organisational, technical and physical safeguards and procedures in order to protect personal information from unauthorised access, use, interference, modification or disclosure. </span></p>
<p class="p5" style="color: black;font-size: 14px;"><span class="s1">For example, your personal information is kept securely in our database.&nbsp;Your personal information will only be accessed by people at&nbsp;</span><span>NZ Photos</span>&nbsp;who need to use the information for the purposes discussed above.</p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1" style="color: black;font-size: 14px;">Some of our products and services do however require use of the internet, and the internet is not itself a secure environment. We therefore cannot give an absolute assurance or guarantee that User information will be secure at all times. Transmission of information over the internet or third-party networks is at the User’s own risk. We will notify Users at the first reasonable opportunity if we discover or are advised of a material security breach which has resulted in unauthorised access, disclosure or loss of User personal information.</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1" style="color: black;">To help maintain the security of information, Users agree to keep their passwords and account details private and confidential.</span></p>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 21px;"><b>5. Links and Connections to THIRD Party Services</b></h4>
<ol class="ol1"></ol>
<p class="p8"><span class="s1" style="color: black;font-size: 14px;">Our website contains links to and may be used by you in conjunction with third-party services, tools, and websites that are not controlled or managed by us. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties’ own privacy policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties. You should review the privacy statements or policies applicable to these third-party services.</span></p>
<p class="p8">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="font-size: 20px;"><b>6. Retention and deletion of personal Information</b></h4>
<ol class="ol1"></ol>
<p class="p3" style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="s1" style="color: black;">The period of time for which we continue to hold any other personal information which we have collected varies according to what the personal information is used or required for. Unless there is a legal requirement or justification for us to keep the personal information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1" style="font-size: 14px;">
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">To provide the products and/or services requested by the User;</span>

<span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">For any other purpose(s) authorised by the User.&nbsp;</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1" style="color: black;">Once personal information is no longer required, the personal information will be deleted or securely destroyed.</span></p>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="p6" style="font-size: 21px;"><b>7. Choices available to users for the collection, use, transfer and disclosure of personal information</b></h4>
<ol class="ol1"></ol>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1" style="color: black;">Users may, at any time, object to the collection, use, transfer or disclosure of personal information as described in this Privacy and Data Policy, including:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1" style="font-size: 14px;">
<li class="li3">
<span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The collection of personal information from third parties;</span>

<span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The disclosure of personal information to third parties; or</span>
</li>
<li class="li5">
<span class="s2"></span><span class="s1">The processing of personal information in a particular way, or for a particular purpose.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Provided the information is not required for legal reasons, Users may also request that all personal information held by us (or shared with third parties) in relation to that User is deleted. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">All requests or objections should be sent to us at privacy@nz.photos.</span><span class="s4"> </span><span class="s1" style="font-size: 14px;">Because User choices in relation to personal information may affect our ability to provide our products and/or services, or the performance of the products /services, we will contact Users as soon as possible to discuss the impact of the User’s requests or objections on the products / services, any other issues arising and to confirm the User’s intention to proceed. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><b>Direct Marketing</b></span></p>
<p class="p6" style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="s1">We will endeavour to include “unsubscribe” functions in any direct marketing communications sent to Users, or alternatively, Users may revoke their consent by sending an email to privacy@nz.photos.</span></p>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
<h4 class="p6" style="font-size: 20px;"><b>8. Accessing and Updating User Personal Information</b></h4>
<ol class="ol1"></ol>
<p class="p5" style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="s1">Users are responsible for ensuring that personal information provided to us is accurate, complete and up-to-date. This includes personal or sensitive information contained in their User content. We will also take reasonable steps to ensure that any personal information that we collect (i.e. information obtained from other sources) is accurate, up-to-date, complete and not misleading. </span></p>
<p class="p5" style="font-size: 14px;"><span class="s1">We endeavour to provide Users with reasonable access to personal information we hold about Users, and Users may request that we update, correct or delete any personal information that is inaccurate or inappropriate for the purposes for which it was collected.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 14px;">Requests for access to or the correction of personal information should be emailed to privacy@nz.photos. </span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1" style="font-size: 14px;">We will process requests as soon as reasonably practicable, provided we are not otherwise prevented from doing so by law. If we are unable to meet a User’s request, we will explain the reasons why. For example, the information may not be readily retrievable and it may not be reasonable or practicable for us to process the request in the manner requested. In some instances, it may also be necessary for us to arrange access to User personal information through a third party (for example, our service providers and supply partners).</span></p>
<p class="p6">&nbsp;</p>
